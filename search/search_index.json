Browsing General exploration and browsing can help you explore the different types of data and studies available on TraceBase. For example, it is easy to check infusion rates and Fcirc for a tracer without downloading anything from TraceBase. To begin browsing, select one of the boxes from the homepage, or a Table from the sidebar. This brings you to a table containing relevant information depending on what you've selected. In the example below, \"Studies\" was selected. Each table can be viewed fullscreen, searched, downloaded, and columns can be added or removed (many tables have some columns hidden by default). Some items within a table include links to see more information. Selecting the first study opens a new page with more details for that specific study: After browsing to a subset samples, the actual data can be viewed by selecting the links for PeakGroups , PeakData , and Fcirc . Clicking these links takes you to an advanced search page that matches what you had previously viewed. ADVANCED SEARCH The advanced search page provides a method to rapidly drill down to exactly what you\u2019re looking for, and export what you have found as a downloaded data file.

Unique information consists of identifying sample information. Individual samples are associated with an Animal, which is itself part of a Study. A Study is the original collection of Animals as defined by the researcher who uploaded them. This information is provided by the Researcher in the Sample Information Sheet . Although samples are organized in this way, data from different studies can be searched, browsed, or downloaded together in TraceBase. Standardized data refers to Sample and Compound attributes that are kept consistent across datasets in TraceBase. Examples of these consistent data include compound names, tissue names, researcher names, and key animal attributes including diet, age, sex, and infusion information. This also includes protocols for Animal Treatments and mass spectrometry (MS). This ensures that data can be compiled and compared across different studies. Consistency is ensured by developers that review data submitted for upload. Calculated data are found in three types of output: PeakData , PeakGroups , and Fcirc . Some calculations rely on other sample attributes (ie Normalized Labeling uses the Enrichment of the tracer compound in a specific serum sample from that animal). Calculated values are generally comparable across experiments.","title":"Structure of TraceBase for the Researcher"},{"location":"Types%20of%20Data%20Output/Downloaded%20Data%20Formats/","text":"Downloaded Data Formats Downloaded Data Downloaded Data ( PeakData , PeakGroups , Fcirc ) are formatted as TSV (Tab Separated Values).

Typically, Fcirc is measured by infusing a labeled tracer to a steady state and measuring its dilution in the animal. The labeling of the tracer compound in serum and the known rate of tracer infusion are used to calculate Fcirc. There are key assumptions of steady state and minimal perturbation in typical calculations of Fcirc - see the above reference for details. Types of Fcirc A researcher may wish to calculate multiple forms of Fcirc depending on their experimental goals. These forms are based on whether the tracer infusion is included in the flux (Ra vs Rd) and whether the intact or atom-averaged flux is preferred. TraceBase calculates all of four of these. (from Bartman, TeSlaa, and Rabinowitz) TraceBase automates the standard calculations for Fcirc without making any assumptions. Note that TraceBase attempts to calculate Fcirc for every serum/plasma sample, so it will sometimes estimate Fcirc that is invalid (ie before steady state) . In other cases, TraceBase will report an Ra value in an infusion that was perturbative. This can still be a useful and valid measurement, but it should not be interpreted as the normal circulatory flux (Fcirc). Finally, Fcirc can either be normalized to animal body weight (reported as nmol/minute/gram body weight) or not (nmol/minute/mouse). TraceBase calculates all of these so that the researcher can select the appropriate measurement. For Multiple Tracers or Labeled Elements If multiple tracers are infused in one animal, Fcirc values are calculated for each tracer compound. If multiple elements are labeled in a given tracer, Fcirc values are calculated separately for each element. This was a specific design choice made to enable comparison of tracer infusions across different studies. For example, Fcirc-intact for carbon can be directly compared between an animal given U13C-alanine infusion and another animal given U13C-15N-alanine infusion. Note that for \u201cintact\u201d Fcirc values, this is different than \u201cany transformation\u201d.

TraceBase uses the Sample Information Sheet to label and organize this data, and produces three types of output formats .","title":"Input Data for TraceBase"},{"location":"Upload/Labeling%20and%20Organizing%20Data/","text":"Labeling and Organizing Data Key Information for TraceBase TraceBase is designed to match an LCMS sample name found in an input file (Accucor or IsoCorr) to a biological sample (specific tissue from a specific animal, listed in the Sample Information Sheet ). Most importantly, the Sample ID and Animal ID should be unique for a given Study. If the Animal ID or Sample ID is not unique, upload is still possible. Feel free to upload what you have and developers are happy to help. Recommended Best Practices To make upload easy, you could include this key information in the sample name of your input Accucor or IsoCorr file: Animal ID Tissue Time Collected The following workflow for labeling / organizing everything will work well with TraceBase (and might be useful generally). Scheme for Unique Experiment, Animal, and Sample IDs For a new experiment, create a new identifier counting up from \u201cstudy001\u201d, and sometimes include a short identifier or name for the experiment. (e.g. \"study001_hyperthyroid glucose infusion\"). Now you can reference this experiment ID (\"study001\") elsewhere. A different experiment may have a new identifier (e.g. \"study002_hypothyroid glucose infusion\"). A related follow up experiment may have an extension to the identifier, e.g. \u201cstudy001b_hyperthyroid lactate infusion\u201d. Any text could be used in place of \u201cstudy\u201d. Within each experiment, animal ID counts up from 001 \u201cstudy001_m01, study001_m02\u2026\u201d. A unique sample file can then be created by adding to this animal ID: provide full animal identifier, tissue, and sometimes time collected: E.g. \u201cstudy001_m01_quad, study001_m01_tailserum_000, study001_m01_tailserum_120\u201d Some researchers keep a single list of Animal IDs for all experiments (e.g. 0001, 0002, etc) This works well for TraceBase, because each Animal ID is unique. Apply this scheme when performing LCMS When loading samples to run LCMS, apply this labeling scheme: Create a folder for each sequence that includes the date of LCMS and experiment identifier. Label samples according to biological entity (e.g. \"study001_plasma_0\") If running the same samples multiple times (e.g. positive mode / negative mode), save each result in a different destination folder. When analyzed in Maven/El-Maven and processed for isotope correction, the resulting sample names will be easy to label for upload to TraceBase. LCMS data for a single biological entity can be generated from multiple LCMS experiments (e.g. \"positive\" vs \"negative\" mass spectrometry, alternative extraction methods, etc). There are two general methods for handling this: Option 1: include method information in the sample name (e.g. append \"hilicPos\") Option 2: leave sample name the same for every biological entity, and generate separate Accucor / Isocorr files for each type of method. This requires saving results into separate folders on the LCMS. This option is easiest to implement for upload to TraceBase because it keeps your Sample Information Sheet simple. Apply this scheme everywhere These labeling schemes can be applied to your general organization of data outside of TraceBase. Data and any other information related to your experiments can be organized into one folder labeled for each study \u201cstudy001_my first infusion\u201d, \u201cstudy001b_fixing my first infusion\u201d. Put everything related to the experiment in this folder, for example: mouse information sheets sample information sheets (even a copy of the TraceBase Sample Information Sheet ) LCMS data (mzxml) accucor / isocorr files Maven project files R / python scripts for analyzing this data In your lab notebook, create page(s) for each experiment ID. When working with samples in the lab, it is not feasible to label every tube with the full identifier, but shorthand can be used for intermediate tubes if everything is from the same study: E.g. when extracting tissue from only study001, label working tubes with minimal info \u201cQ1, Q2\u201d. Label final tubes with as much information as possible (e.g. \"001_M1_Q\"). Label boxes stored in freezers with study identifier, a relevant date, and your initials (e.g. \"study001_glucose infusion\", \"study001b_lactate infusion\"...)","title":"Labeling and Organizing Data"},{"location":"Upload/Labeling%20and%20Organizing%20Data/#labeling-and-organizing-data","text":"","title":"Labeling and Organizing Data"},{"location":"Upload/Labeling%20and%20Organizing%20Data/#key-information-for-tracebase","text":"TraceBase is designed to match an LCMS sample name found in an input file (Accucor or IsoCorr) to a biological sample (specific tissue from a specific animal, listed in the Sample Information Sheet ).

For example, lactate (C3H6O3) can be measured in samples from an animal infused with N-labeled glutamine (C5H10N2O3), but no nitrogen enrichment or normalized labeling is reported for lactate. For infusates with multiple tracers, SerumTracerPeakGroup.enrichment_fraction = average of enrichment in each serum tracer group. The SerumTracerPeakGroup depends on some edge cases: - if two serum samples were collected on the same date and same minutes after the start of infusion, (ie they are biological replicates), the specific value selected is arbitrary. - if the same SerumTracerPeakGroup is repeated in multiple MSruns (appears in multiple accucor files), the most recent uploaded data is selected.","title":"Normalized Labeling"},{"location":"Values/Normalized%20Labeling/#normalized-labeling","text":"Found in PeakGroups Github Link The enrichment in this compound normalized to the enrichment in the tracer compound(s) from the final serum timepoint for that animal.
