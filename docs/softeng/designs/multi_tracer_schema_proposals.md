# MultiTracer Schema Change Proposals

In order to better track reviews of new/proposed schema designs, I thought I would create a branch that adds this document that lists current schema proposals that were submitted in comments to:

[Issue #391](https://github.com/Princeton-LSI-ResearchComputing/tracebase/issues/391)

For reference, I have created a:

- [UML diagram of the current database schema](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Vo3bi0EX9VJxFHVHXzoCCb6LlWLWgcW2I8LskQEoHws/edit?usp=sharing)

## Designs

So far we have 2 schema ideas to consider, linked below.  Please review the designs and create "issues" by adding comments to the google docs.  I imagine this may take a few rounds as we go back and forth.  When you finish a review, please submit a review in the PR for this branch with your overall thoughts/assessment.

I will submit the PR and paste in a checklist for the submitted design versions.  I'm still trying to figure out the best way to perform these reviews, so feel free to propose alternatives.
