      Metabolites were analyzed using a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC System (Thermo
      Scientific). Waters XBridge BEH Amide XP Column [particle size, 2.5 μm;
      150 mm (length) × 2.1 mm (i.d.)] was used for hydrophilic interaction
      chromatography (HILIC) separation. Column temperature was kept at 25 °C.
      Mobile phases A = 20 mM ammonium acetate and 22.5 mM ammonium hydroxide in
      95:5 (v/v) water:acetonitrile (pH 9.45) and B = 100% acetonitrile were
      used for both ESI positive and negative modes. The linear gradient eluted
      from 90% B (0.0 to 2.0 min), 90% B to 75% B (2.0 to 3.0 min), 75% B (3.0
      to 7.0 min), 75% B to 70% B (7.0 to 8.0 min), 70% B (8.0 to 9.0 min), 70%
      B to 50% B (9.0 to 10.0 min), 50% B (10.0 to 12.0 min), 50% B to 25% B
      (12.0 to 13.0 min), 25% B (13.0 to 14.0 min), 25% B to 0.5% B (14.0 to
      16.0 min), 0.5% B (16.0 to 20.5 min), then stayed at 90% B for 4.5 min.
      The total run time is 25 min. The flow rate was 0.15 mL/min.

      LC platform consists of Accela U-HPLC system with quaternary pumps, HTC
      PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switchland), and Keystone hot
      pocket column heater (all from ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA,
      unless otherwise noted). Liquid chromatography separation was achieved on
      a Synergy Hydro-RP column (100 × 2 mm, 2.5 µm particle size, Phenomenex,
      Torrance, CA), using reversed-phase chromatography with the ion pairing
      agent tributylamine in the aqueous mobile phase to enhance retention and
      separation 23–25. The total run time is 25 min. Flow rate is 200 µl/min.
      Solvent A is 97:3 water:methanol with 10 mM tributylamine and 15 mM acetic
      acid; solvent B is methanol. The gradient is: 0 min, 0% B; 2.5 min, 0% B;
      5 min, 20% B;7.5 min, 20% B; 13 min, 55% B; 15.5 min, 95% B; 18.5 min, 95%
      B; 19 min, 0% B; 25 min, 0% B. Other LC parameters are autosampler
      temperature 4°C, injection volume 10 µl, and column temperature 25°C.
