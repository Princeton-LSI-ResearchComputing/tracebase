    run_length: "00:25:00"
    description: >-
      This method involves the analysis of polar metabolites using
      reversed-phase ion pairing chromatography on C18 columns, coupled with
      high resolution mass spectrometry. It provides good separation and
      detection for polar metabolites in negative ion mode, in particular
      phosphate metabolites.
