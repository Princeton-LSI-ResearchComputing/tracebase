        <p>An important part of TraceBase is collecting and maintaining a consistent set of metadata for each sample.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make a copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1To3495KxJkAtnAD9KVdzc162zKbNiYuPEVyPseQPjMQ/copy">Tracebase Animal and Sample Table Template</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Fill in the <em>Animals</em> sheet
                <ol>
                    <li>Give each mouse in your study a <em>unique id</em>.</li>
                    <li>Fill in additional details about each of the mice in your study. Note that
                        there are comments in the column headers to help describe each of the
                        fields.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pay particular attention to the <em>Tracer Compound</em>, <em>Tracer Labeled
                        Element</em>, <em>Tracer Label Atom Count</em>, <em>Feeding Status</em>, <em>Treatment</em>, and
                        <em>Study</em> fields.

                <ol>
                    <li><em>IMPORTANT</em> - Ensure that the <em>Sample Name</em> column is consistent with the
                        sample names in your AccuCor files.
                </li>
                <li>Fill in additional sample details, making sure that the <em>Tissue</em> values
                    match one of those in the <em>Tissue</em> sheet and the <em>Animal ID</em> values match
                    one of those in the <em>Animals</em> sheet.

    <h2 id="optional-validate-your-data">Optional: Validate your data</h2>
    <p>In order to expedite the loading process, you can check your data submission to
        resolve simple discrepancies by running your files through our <a href="{% url 'validate' %}">automated
            validation script</a>.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download your Animal and Sample Table in Excel format.</li>
        <li>Submit the Excel file on the <a href="{% url 'validate' %}">TraceBase validation page</a>.</li>
        <li>Fix any errors reported, re-download the table and validate the new Excel file.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In general, you should NOT edit your AccuCor files. It&#39;s simplest and often
            best to resolve issues by editing your animal and sample table file.
        </li>
        <li>If you have any questions about how to format the files or any validation
            errors, don&#39;t hesitate to <a href="mailto:csgenome@princeton.edu?subject=TraceBase study submission
