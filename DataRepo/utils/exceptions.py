class InfileError(Exception):

    It brings consistency between error types to make all exceptions that reference a position in a table-like file,
    conform to a single way of formatting file location information (file name, excel sheet name, row number, and column
    name (or number)).

    Often, the derived class may opt to list multiple columns or row numbers (but reference the same file or sheet), so
    none of the arguments are required.  If none are provided, the file will be generically referenced (showing that the
    erroneous data is located in an input file (as opposed to a database, for example)).

    ```

    exceptions using object.buffer_error(), object.buffer_warning(), and (where the error/warning can change based on a
    boolean) object.buffer_exception(is_error=boolean_variable).  You can also decide whether a warning should be
    raised as an exception or not using the is_fatal parameter.  This is intended to be able to report a warning to the

    A caught exception can be buffered, but you can also buffer an exception class that is constructed outside of a
    try/except block.

    Note, this class annotates the exceptions it buffers.  Each exception is available in the object.exceptions array
    and each exception contains the following data members.

    Instance Attributes:
        buffered_tb_str - a string version of a traceback (because a regular traceback will not exist if an
                          exception is not raised).  Note, exceptions with their traces will be printed on
                          standard out unless object.quiet is True.
        is_error        - a boolean indicating whether it is a warning or an exception.
        exc_type_str    - a string ("Warning" or "Error") that can be used in custom reporting.

    This exception is raised as a warning when the number of `mzXML` files with the same name are not all accounted for
    in the `Peak Annotation Details` sheet of the Study Doc.  I.e. there are more `mzXML` files than peak annotation
    files with sample headers of this name.

    There are a number of ways this can happen:
        - The extra files are empty (and are reported in `NoScans` warnings).
        - A peak annotation file for the extras has not been included in the load.
        - The sample was re-analyzed in a subsequence MS Run because there was a problem with the first run.
        - There are 2 different biological samples with the same name and one is not included in the current submission.

    The first case is handled automatically and can be safely ignored.  In fact, if it is any other case, an error would
    be raised after this warning, so in any case, this can be ignored, but if subsequent error does occur, this warning
    provides information that can help figure out the problem.

    In all of the other cases, there are 2 ways to resolve the warning:

    - Add rows to the `Peak Annotation Details` sheet that account for all the files (adding 'skip' to the Skip column\
      for any files that should be ignored).  This is the preferred solution.
    - Add the relative path from the study folder to the specific mzXML file in the existing 'mzXML File Name' column\
      (not including the study folder name).

    Despite the 'required columns' highlighted in blue indicating that `Sample Name` and `Sample Data Header` are
    required, when there is no associated peak annotation file, the `mzXML File Name`, `Sequence`, and `Skip` columns
    are all that's required.  This is a special case.

    If all of the files are for the same MS Run, nothing further is needed.  But if they are from different MS Runs, the
    `mzXML File Name` column must contain the relative path from the study folder to the `mzXML` file (not including the
    study folder name).

    """An `mzXML` file was found under the study directory that does not match any sample names in the
    `Peak Annotation Details` sheet.

    This can occur if there are `mzXML` files from samples that have not been used to produce a peak annotation file
    yet, i.e. totally unanalyzed samples.  It can also occur if an existing peak annotation file was overlooked when
    generating the Study Doc on the Upload Start page.

    The resolution depends on what you want to do.  If you want to ignore these `mzXML` files that are unanalyzed, and
    put off their load until a subsequent submission or a later addendum to this submission, every unaccounted-for
    `mzXML File Name`, its `Sequence`, and a `Skip` value must be added to the `Peak Annotation Details` sheet (leaving
    the "required" columns blank - an alternative set of required columns).  Or you could create a separate study folder
    and move the extra `mzXML` files there.

    If you want to load these `mzXML` files, the best way to proceed is to generate a new template on the Upload
    **Start** page and copy your work from the old study doc to the new one, being careful to note differences such as
    newly inserted ordered sample rows in the `Samples` sheet.

    There are a few reasons for this strategy.  One of the big ones is that only the **Start** page checks for
    `Peak Group Conflicts`.  The other big one is that multiple linked sheets are consistently populated and all inter-
    sheet references are maintained, which is laborious and error prone when attempted manually.

class MultiplePeakGroupRepresentation(SummarizableError):
    """A peak group for a measured compound was picked multiple times and abundance corrected for 1 or more samples.

    TraceBase requires that the single best representation of a peak group compound be loaded for any one sample.

    Certain compounds can show up in both positive and negative scans, or in abutting scan ranges of the same polarity.
    While neither representation may be perfect, this simple requirement prevents inaccuracies or mistakes when using
    the data from TraceBase.

    Be wary however that your compound names in your peak annotation files are consistently named, because different
    synonyms are not detected as multiple peak group representations.  This was a design decision to support succinct
    compound records while also supporting stereo-isomers.  (Note: This distinction may go away in a future version of
    TraceBase, where synonyms are treated as the same compound in the context of peak groups.)

    Multiple peak group representations are only detected and reported on the Upload **Start** page, when the peak
    annotation files have their compounds and samples extracted.  The multiple representations are recorded in an
    otherwise hidden sheet in the Study Doc named `Peak Group Conflicts`.

    For every row in the conflicts sheet, a peak annotation file drop-down is supplied to pick the file from which the
    peak group should be loaded.  The same peak group compound from the other file(s) will be skipped.

    If you forgot a peak annotation file when generating your study doc template, start over with a complete generated
    Study Doc in order to catch these issues.  But note, previously loaded Peak Group records are included in the
    detection of multiple representations, so alternatively, you may choose to add forgotten peak annotation files in a
    separate submission, keeping in mind that if you select the new peak annotation file as the peak group
    representation to load, the old previously loaded peak group will be deleted.

    Note that while manual editing of this sheet is discouraged, you can manually edit it as long as you preserve the
    hidden column.  There is a hidden sample column containing delimited sample names.  This column is required to
    accurately update all multiple representations.

    Lastly, this issue can arise if the conflicting compound record simply has a synonym associated with a compound
    record that is just wrong.

    To resolve this issue, either merge the compound records (editing them to fix the formula) or remove the synonym
    from the differing compound record so that peak groups (and tracers) are associated with the other compound record.

    If the compound from the peak annotation file(s) differs from the existing TraceBase compound record (e.g. different
    formula or HMDB ID), and the new record represents a distinctly different compound, reach out to the curators.  The
    existing compound name may already be associated with a different compound in other studies, so either changes would
    need to be made to those other studies or the new study would need to be edited to distinguish the different
    compounds.  Either way, a curator will need to coordinate the fix to ensure database-wide consistency.
