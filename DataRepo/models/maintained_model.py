    This is a decorator factory for functions in a Model class that are identified to be used to update a supplied
    field and field of any linked parent/child record (for when the record is changed).  This function returns a
    decorator that takes the decorated function.  That function should not use the value of another maintained field in
    its calculation because the order of update is not guaranteed to occur in a favorable series.  It should return a
    value compatible with the field type supplied.

    These decorated functions are identified by the MaintainedModel class, whose save and delete methods override the
    parent model and call the decorated functions to update field supplied to the factory function.  It also propagates
    the updates to the linked dependent model's save methods (if the parent and/or child field name is supplied), the
    assumption being that a change to "this" record's maintained field necessitates a change to another maintained
    field in the linked parent record.  Parent and child field names should only be supplied if a change to "this"
    record means that related foields in parent/child records will need to be recomputed.  There is no need to supply
    parent/child field names if that is not the case.

    The generation input is an integer indicating the hierarchy level.  E.g. if there is no parent, `generation` should
    be 0.  Each subsequence generation should increment generation.  It is used to populate update_buffer when
    auto_updates is False, so that mass updates can be triggered after all data is loaded.

    Note that a class can have multiple fields to update and that those updates (according to their decorators) can
    trigger subsequent updates in different "parent"/"child" records.  If multiple update fields trigger updates to
    different parents, they are triggered in a depth-first fashion.  Child records are updated first, then parents.  If
    a child links back to a parent, already-updated records prevent repeated/looped updates.  However, this only
    becomes relevant when the global variable `auto_updates` is False, mass database changes are made (buffering the
    auto-updates), and then auto-updates are explicitly triggered.

    Note, if there are many decorated methods updating different fields, and all of the "parent"/"child" fields are the
    same, only 1 of those decorators needs to set a parent field.
