# Uploading Data to TraceBase

To get started, click the upload button in the menu bar at the top of the page.

The upload process process ensures that samples are labeled accurately and that
new data is consistent with existing data in TraceBase.  Your data is initially
uploaded to a private folder, then a developer checks the data to ensure it is
formatted correctly, and when ready the developer adds the data to TraceBase.
This means it is OK (and expected) for your data to be imperfectly labeled when
you initially submit for upload.

## Step-by-step instructions

1. Create a submission template (a.k.a. a "Study doc")
    - Click the "Upload" tab at the top of any page of TraceBase.
    - Upload your peak annotation files (e.g. "AccuCor") to generate a template.
      The samples and compounds will be extracted and added to the template to
      give you a head start.

2. Fill in the template with data about your samples
    - Follow the directions under the "Fill In" tab to flesh out your study doc
      with all the details of your study.

3. Check your Study doc for errors
    - Under the "Validate" tab, submit your filled-in study doc to download a
      version containing some minor repairs and an error report.
    - You can either proceed to submission or try and fix any of the reported
      errors and re-validate.

4. Submit your data
    - Under the "Submit" tab, follow the directions on where to deposit your
      data.
    - Click the "Submission Form" button and fill out the resulting form to let
      the curators know that your submission is done.

What happens next?

We will review your study to ensure that everything will load smoothly. If
there are any issues, we will contact you to sort everything out. The study
data will be loaded into TraceBase and we'll send you an email with a link to
view the data to make sure everything looks correct and you can start browsing
your data.

[Contact us](https://forms.gle/LNk4kk6RJKZWM6za9) anytime if you have any
questions, concerns, or comments. If, after your submission, you need to
follow-up or would like to check-in on the upload status, [let us
know](https://forms.gle/LNk4kk6RJKZWM6za9).

## FAQ

Do my compound names need to match TraceBase compound names?

* No.  TraceBase maintains a list of primary compound names associated with
  synonyms.  If you upload data with a new compound name, we will contact you
  to resolve the difference.  If it is a new compound, then your name becomes
  the primary compound name.  If your name matches an existing compound in
  TraceBase, then your name is added as a synonym, and your next upload will
  not have any issues.

I have a new Tissue.  How do I upload?

* In the sample information workbook, on the Tissues tab, add your new Tissue
  name to the list.  Label your samples with this new Tissue name.  When you
  submit the google form, tell the developer you are adding a new Tissue.

Can I upload multiple data files at once?

* Yes!  Upload as many data files as you want.  Ideally, use only one Sample
  Information Sheet.

My sample names in one Accucor/Isocorr file are not unique (ie `Mouse1_Q`,
`Mouse2_Q`, `Mouse3_Q` in one data file for one experiment, and `Mouse1_Q`,
`Mouse2_Q`, `Mouse3_Q` in a second data file for a second experiment).  Can I
upload these together?

* Yes, but we will work with you to ensure data is uploaded correctly.
  Ideally, every sample name in the data file should correspond to one unique
  biological sample in this `Study`.  Upload what you have, then contact us and
  we can help you upload these data.

I modified my data files before uploading them (ie added rows for sample
information).  Can I upload these files?

* Yes.  We will help you come up with an easy solution for uploading modified
  files.  Just upload what you have and we will contact you to confirm our
  solution is OK.

Can I upload some data now, and upload more data from the same samples later?

* Yes.  TraceBase will add new data to existing samples.  If the same compound
  is uploaded a second time, TraceBase will use the latest upload.

What kind of data can be uploaded?

* See [[Input Data for TraceBase Upload]]
