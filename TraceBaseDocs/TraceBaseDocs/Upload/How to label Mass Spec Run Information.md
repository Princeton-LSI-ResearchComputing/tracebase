# How to label Mass Spec Run Information

Information about the Mass Spectrometry used is collected in a google form when
data is submitted.

A description of each field is listed here:

## Mass Spec Run Date

- Date that the sequence was ran on on the machine

## Mass Spec Operator

- Researcher who prepared samples for MS and ran them on the machine

## LC Method

- Description of Liquid Chromatography method and run length used
- Possible values:
  - unknown
  - polar-HILIC-25-min
  - polar-reversed-phase-ion-pairing-25-min
  - polar-reversed-phase-25-min
  - lipid-reversed-phase-25-min
- If the method/run-length is not available, please also include a description
  - Example Description: lipid-reversed-phase-25-min
    This method involves the analysis of lipids using reversed-phase
    chromatography on C18 columns, coupled with high resolution mass
    spectrometry. It is mainly used for the analysis of lipids.

## MS Mode

- Description of Mass Spectrometry method used
- General descriptions are adequate
- Example  "negative" or "positive" or "negative SIM"
