# How TraceBase Handles Data

## Types of Values

TraceBase consists of three basic types of information:

* Experimental
* Standardized
* Calculated

![TraceBase data organization diagram](../Attachments/Structure%20of%20Tracebase%20Sketch.png)

**Experimental** information is the metadata that describes the conditions of the experiment.  It provides context for
the *Calculated* values, without which, the results are meaningless.  This data is organized hierarchically by *Study*,
*Animal*, and *Sample*, each of which is associated with a globally unique name/identifier.  I.e. Individual Samples are
associated with an Animal, which is itself part of one or more Studies.  A Study is a collection of Animals as defined
by the researcher who uploaded them.  This information is provided by the Researcher in the Samples sheet of the
[Study Doc](../Upload/How%20to%20Build%20a%20Submission/2%20-%20How%20to%20Fill%20In%20the%20Study%20Doc.md). Although
samples are organized in this way, data from different studies can be searched, browsed, or downloaded together in
TraceBase.

**Standardized** data refers to Sample and Compound attributes that are kept consistent across datasets in TraceBase.
Examples of these consistent data include compound names, tissue names, researcher names, and key animal attributes
including diet, age, sex, and infusion information.  This also includes protocols for Animal Treatments and mass
spectrometry (MS).  This ensures that data can be compiled, compared, and searched across different studies.
Consistency is ensured by developers that review data submitted for upload.  Standardized data can be added or modified
during a study submission to TraceBase by researchers, but is subject to curator review to ensure consistency and a
standard nomenclature throughout the database.

**Calculated** data (or "derived data") is generated by TraceBase from the originally uploaded data.  TraceBase
dynamically maintains these calculated values for constant accuracy.  Calculated data can be found in three types of
output: [PeakData](../Download/About%20the%20Data/Data%20Types/PeakData.md),
[PeakGroups](../Download/About%20the%20Data/Data%20Types/PeakGroups.md), and
[FCirc](../Download/About%20the%20Data/Data%20Types/FCirc.md).  Some calculations rely on other calculated data (e.g.
[Normalized Labeling](../Values/Normalized%20Labeling.md) of a measured compound in a PeakGroup from one sample uses the
[Enrichment Fraction](../Values/Enrichment%20Fraction.md) of the tracer compound in the last serum sample from the same
animal).  Calculated values are comparable across experiments.  Calculated values can be affected by changes to or
additions of records in the database.  For example, a researcher discovers previously overlooked serum sample data after
an already completed (and loaded) submission.  The researcher then uploads additional data for that serum sample, and
TraceBase updates the (previously missing) Fcirc value (and any other calculated values related to the new data).

## <a name="curated_v_raw"></a>Raw Versus Curated Data

TraceBase is a portal primarily for exploring manually curated data.  Researchers have inspected the Mass Spec peaks,
identified the compounds they came from, and grouped and quantified the isotopic variant peaks that represent that
compound.  It is that data to which TraceBase's calculations are applied.

However, TraceBase also tracks the raw data (e.g. mzXML files) from which those peaks were derived.  Each raw file
potentially contains all the peak information (i.e. every detected compound) associated with a single sample.  The
manually picked and identified compounds selected from this raw data is a subset of the information it contains.  Hence,
much of the information in a raw file is "unanalyzed".  It may represent unidentified, ambiguous, or unknown compounds.
Or it may just represent the compounds that are unrelated to the scientific question the researcher was interested in
when they generated it.

Since one of TraceBase's primary goals is to make this unanalyzed data accessible, it's important to understand the
relationship between the curated data and the raw data.  The following is a simplified hierarchy of the relationships in
the database:

> `Study` > `Animal` > `Sample` > **`MSRunSample`** > `PeakGroup` > `PeakData`

where a Study contains animals, an animal contains samples, etc.

A single biological `Sample` can have multiple `MSRunSample` records associated with it for a few reasons:

* Technical replicates
* A sample tube on the Mass Spec was injected twice
* **Multiple `mzXML` files were produced**.

[Raw files](TraceBaseDocs/TraceBaseDocs/Upload/What%20Inputs%20Does%20TraceBase%20Take.md#raw_data) (both `.raw` and
`.mzXML`) link to an `MSRunSample` and an `MSRunSample` contains multiple `PeakGroup` records.

### Display of Raw Files

You may note on TraceBase that a `PeakGroup` can be associated with multiple `mzXML` files.  That's because a
`PeakGroup` cannot currently be associated with a specific `mzXML` file it came from, as there is not a reliable
programatic means to reliably associate them - only to the group of `mzXML` files associated with the `Sample`.^

TraceBase handles this using placeholder `MSRunSample` records.  If a `Sample` has more than 1 `mzXML` file, a
placeholder is created that all of the `PeakGroup` records link to.  (This is also used when `mzXML` files are not
included in the submission.)

^ *This is planned to change in a future version of TraceBase.*

### Loading Raw Files

In practice, the only raw files that are loaded into TraceBase are those that have been imported into El-Maven and had
peaks picked from them and used for natural abundance correction with (for example) *AccuCor*, but TraceBase **can**
load completely unanalyzed/unprocessed raw files.  The only requirements are that they must be associated with each of
these types of database records:

* `MSRunSequence`
* `Sample`

The `MSRunSequence` and `Sample` must be linked with the raw file(s) in the
[Peak Annotation Details](../Upload/How%20to%20Build%20a%20Submission/2%20-%20How%20to%20Fill%20In%20the%20Study%20Doc.md#details)
sheet of a submitted Study Doc, even if there is no associated peak annotation file.  If a `Sample` does not exist for
it in the
[`Samples`](../Upload/How%20to%20Build%20a%20Submission/2%20-%20How%20to%20Fill%20In%20the%20Study%20Doc.md#samples)
sheet, the raw file(s) cannot be loaded.

All submitted `raw` and `mzXML` files are automatically loaded when a study is submitted, whether they were used in the
production of a peak annotation file or not.  If the associated records don't exist in the Study Doc, an error will be
raised when the curator attempts the load.

### Searching for Raw Data Files

Note that all search functionality on TraceBase is geared toward curated peak data.  Even though polarity and scan range
metadata is automatically extracted and saved in an `MSRunSample` record, if you are searching the `PeakData` or
`PeakGroups` format, you will not find those unanalyzed raw files because they have no picked peaks associated with
them.  To retrieve totally unanalyzed raw files, you must locate them on the `Archive Files` page.
