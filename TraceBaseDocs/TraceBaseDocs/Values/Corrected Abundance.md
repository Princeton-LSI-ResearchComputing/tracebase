# Corrected Abundance

Found in the [PeakData](../Download/About%20the%20Data/Data%20Types/PeakData.md) data format.

Ion counts for this isotopomer corrected for natural abundance of heavy isotopes.  Analagous to the "Corrected" tab in
AccuCor output.

No calculations are performed by TraceBase for this value.  The value is determined by any of the supported peak
correction tools ([AccuCor](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00396),
[IsoCor](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz209), or [Iso-AutoCor](https://github.com/xxing9703/Iso-Autocorr))
