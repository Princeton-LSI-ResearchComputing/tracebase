# Navigating TraceBase

TraceBase can be explored in two general ways:

- Samples First:  Browsing pages thru TraceBase
- Data First:  Advanced Search

Both of these methods filter all the data in TraceBase down to what you’re
looking for.

## Browsing

General exploration and browsing can help you explore the different types of
data and studies available on TraceBase.  For example, it is easy to check
infusion rates and Fcirc for a tracer without downloading anything from
TraceBase.

To begin browsing, select one of the boxes from the homepage, or a Table from
the sidebar. ![TraceBase Homepage](../Attachments/Snapshot%20Homepage.png)

This brings you to a table containing relevant information depending on what
you've selected. In the example below, "Studies" was selected.
![Studies table in TraceBase](../Attachments/Snapshot%20Studies%20Table.png)

Each table can be viewed fullscreen, searched, downloaded, and columns can be
added or removed (many tables have some columns hidden by default).  Some items
within a table include links to see more information.  Selecting the first
study opens a new page with more details for that specific study:

After browsing to a subset samples, the actual data can be viewed by selecting
the links for [PeakGroups](../Download/About%20the%20Data/Data%20Types/PeakGroups.md),
[PeakData](../Download/About%20the%20Data/Data%20Types/PeakData.md), and
[Fcirc](../Download/About%20the%20Data/Data%20Types/FCirc.md).  Clicking these links takes
you to an advanced search page that matches what you had previously viewed.

## ADVANCED SEARCH

The advanced search page provides a method to rapidly drill down to exactly
what you’re looking for, and export what you have found as a downloaded data
file.

First, select an output format ([[PeakGroups]], [[PeakData]], or [[Fcirc]]).

Next, filter the sample information.  Note this is filtering from all the data
in TraceBase.  In this example, PeakGroup data is filtered for all infusates
including "glucose" and tissues including "serum".  This produces a result with
697 PeakGroups.

Click the Search button.  This generates an output table with a small set of
columns shown.  To show hidden columns, click the blue columns button at the
top of the table.

To get an overview of what is included, you can click the blue "Stats" button
which will open the following box:
![Summary statistics for advanced search results in TraceBase](../Attachments/Snapshot%20Advanced%20Search%20Stats%20Pane.png)

This box shows the currently filtered data includes 36 Animals, 36 unique
measured compounds, 52 unique samples, etc, in this example.  The Stats tab is
especially useful for identifying Diets, Ages, Genotypes, Feeding Statuses, or
Animal Treatments found within the currently filtered dataset.

Adjust filters and search again, or download the table.

To download the table of whatever you have filtered down into, click the blue
download button.  Note that this downloaded table adheres to strict [Downloaded
Data Formats](../Download/About%20the%20Data/Format%20of%20Downloaded%20Data.md).
