# Data Privacy and Attribution

## Privacy

Access to TraceBase is restricted to a list of Princeton netIDs maintained by the TraceBase development team.

All data on TraceBase can be viewed or downloaded by anyone with access to the site.

Data is housed in a private git repository separate from the TraceBase repository.


## Attribution

All data derived from each animal is associated with a Researcher, or the person primarily responsible for the animal experiment.  During the upload process, additional Researchers might be identified in the google form as the person who ran the LCMS or the person who analyzed raw data pulled peaks in Maven/El-Maven.  Some studies contain animals from multiple Researchers.

Published work using data from TraceBase should cite the Researchers listed in TraceBase.  When TraceBase is published, an appropriate citation will be listed here.
