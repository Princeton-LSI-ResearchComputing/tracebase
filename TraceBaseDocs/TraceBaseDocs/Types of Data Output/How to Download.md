# How to Download

Four types of data can be downloaded from TraceBase:

- [[PeakGroups]]
- [[PeakData]]
- [Fcirc](Fcirc.md)
- TraceBase metadata (Compounds, Tissues, etc)

TraceBase data can be downloaded in three ways:

All the data in TraceBase can be downloaded by clicking the “Download” button
in the top menu bar.  This has strictly defined [Downloaded Data
Formats](Downloaded%20Data%20Formats.md), which can be used for analysis
outside of TraceBase.

Data found in the Advanced Search page can also be downloaded in the same
format by clicking the blue download button.

TraceBase metadata found in other pages (e.g. “Studies” table) can be
downloaded in multiple formats by clicking the blue download button.  These are
typically sample information tables that do not contain the underlying
PeakGroups, PeakData, or Fcirc data.  For example, the Compounds table can be
downloaded as a CSV, TXT, or XLS file.
