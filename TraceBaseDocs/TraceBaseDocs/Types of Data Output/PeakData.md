# PeakData

PeakData is a table of TraceBase output analagous to an accucor input file labeled with sample information.  It contains sample metadata and two basic values:

 - [Corrected Abundance](../Values/Corrected%20Abundance.md) - the abundance of each observed isotopomer for each compound (corrected for natural isotope abundance). (ion counts)
 - [Fraction](../Values/Fraction.md) - the simple fraction of this isotopomer vs all others for this observed compound.

Downloaded PeakData has a [standard format](Downloaded%20Data%20Formats.md).

PeakData is used to construct [[PeakGroups]].
