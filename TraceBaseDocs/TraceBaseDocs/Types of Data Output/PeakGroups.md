# PeakGroups

PeakGroups is a table of TraceBase output with values calculated from
[[PeakData]].  These values are used to summarize or combine all isotopomers
for a given compound.

Each row of PeakGroups reports information for a single labeled element, which
allows for all PeakGroups in TraceBase to be directly compared to each other,
even if they contain multiple labeled elements.

Some key values reported in PeakGroups are:

- [Total Abundance](../Values/Total%20Abundance.md)
- [Enrichment](../Values/Enrichment.md)
- [Enrichment Abundance](../Values/Enrichment%20Abundance.md)
- [Normalized Labeling](../Values/Normalized%20Labeling.md)

Downloaded PeakGroups data has a [standard format](Downloaded%20Data%20Formats.md).
