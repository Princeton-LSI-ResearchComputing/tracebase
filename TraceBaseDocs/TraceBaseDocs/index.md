# TraceBase

![TraceBase logo](Attachments/TraceBase%20logo.png)

TraceBase is a data repository and analysis tool for mass-spectrometry data
from isotope tracing studies used to quantify metabolism in vivo. Lab members
submit data corrected for natural isotope abundance (by AccuCor or IsoCorr),
along with details about their experiment. TraceBase organizes this data and
computes useful metrics such as enrichment, normalized labeling, and FCirc.
Data on TraceBase is easy to browse, collate, compare, and download.
