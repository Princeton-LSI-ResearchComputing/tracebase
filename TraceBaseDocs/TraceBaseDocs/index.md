# TraceBase

![TraceBase logo](Attachments/TraceBase%20logo.png)

TraceBase is a mass spectrometry data repository and analysis tool for isotopic tracing studies used to quantify in vivo
metabolism.  It is designed to be downloaded and installed for individual labs so that lab members can make their
natural isotopic abundance corrected data (along with associated experimental metadata) available to the rest of the
lab.  It currently supports [AccuCor](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00396),
[IsoCor](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz209), and [Iso-AutoCor](https://github.com/xxing9703/Iso-Autocorr).
TraceBase organizes this data and computes useful metrics such as enrichment, normalized labeling, and FCirc.  Data on
TraceBase is easy to browse, collate, compare, and download.
