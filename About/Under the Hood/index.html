                <h1 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h1>
<p>Given a development plan with the outlined <a href="../TraceBase%20Design/#Goals">goals</a>, TraceBase contains a number of hidden
features that end users don't usually see, but bring enormous value to the TraceBase codebase in terms of maintenance
and future development efforts.</p>
<h2 id="search-strategy">Search Strategy</h2>
<p>The advanced search was designed to work on any database table field, and works across numerous tables to construct any
desired hybrid representation using a simple configuration file.  The current representations include, for example
<a href="../../Download/About%20the%20Data/Data%20Types/PeakGroups/">PeakGroups</a>,
<a href="../../Download/About%20the%20Data/Data%20Types/PeakData/">PeakData</a>, and
<a href="../../Download/About%20the%20Data/Data%20Types/FCirc/">FCirc</a>.  The search is performed independent of the
configuration, which means that adding or changing fields/columns is a straightforward and trivial task.  Any changes to
the configuration are instantly searchable.  This design choice is powerful in that the Advanced Search interface is
inherently scalable and adaptable.  New search formats can be created with minimal effort.</p>
<h2 id="caching-strategy">Caching Strategy</h2>
<p>Caching of various expensive-to-calculate values in TraceBase improves performance.  Typical caching strategies
periodically refresh cached values based on a simple cached value expiration date.  However, this strategy has
drawbacks.  During times of low traffic, the periodic rebuilding of values is susceptible to significantly impacting the
performance of a large search results download, for example.</p>
<p>Additionally, if new data is loaded or changed, cached values can be incorrect until affected cached values are rebuilt,
so a user may occasionally be presented with that inaccurate data.</p>
<p>To solve both of these issues, TraceBase employs a caching strategy that sets monitors on specific data that, if it's
ever changed, will trigger an immediate cache update of the affected values.  That means that as long as a study doesn't
change, performance will always be optimal, and the values always accurate.</p>
<h2 id="dynamically-maintained-database-fields">Dynamically Maintained Database Fields</h2>
<p>While the caching strategy above assures data accuracy and consistent performance, it has one big drawback: cached
values are not searchable, which is for example, why you cannot search based on calculated FCirc values.  It also has
occasional maintenance tasks associated with it, such as generating those cached values after a load.</p>
<p>A strategy newer than the caching strategy that solves accuracy, performance, <em>and</em> searchability, is maintained
database table fields, and that work was done with a mind toward both scalability and adaptability.  It works much in
the same way that the caching strategy does, as it triggers updates based on monitored database records, but comes with
extra features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple configurable modes that govern when to perform the updates.</li>
<li>A mass autoupdate feature integrated with the loading scripts (to eliminate all associated overhead tasks).</li>
<li>An extremely small code usage footprint that can</li>
<li>Apply field maintenance to a field in a table with as few as 2 lines of code (when given a method to generate a
    field value), making it highly robust to change.</li>
<li>Apply mass autoupdate functionality to load methods with a single line of code.</li>
<li>Restricts maintained fields from manual updates to ensure accuracy and proper loading code development.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="validation-interface">Validation Interface</h2>
<p>As the most visible under-the-hood feature, the data submission interface's validation page uses the exact same code
that is used to load the database on the backend.  Designing the validation interface this way dramatically reduces
future development efforts and ensures consistency between what users and curators see when working with load data.</p>
<p>One typical pitfall of a large complex data loading (or validation) is that the loading process stops at the first error
it encounters, thus a load attempt is made, an error occurs, the problem is fixed, then you start over and wait through
an entire load attempt again only to encounter another error.  This repeated start/stop is inefficient.  It would be
much more efficient to see all (or as many) of the errors that can be found and then fix them all in one go.  Somtimes,
subsequent errors are unavoidable, but handling them in groups would at least be a step forward.</p>
<p>To reduce the repeated data debugging iterations, the data loading strategy was designed to gather as many errors and
warnings as is possible in a single load/validation attempt.  A number of components and fine-grained strategies
coalesced to contribute to this overall strategy and are described below.</p>
<h3 id="consolidated-input">Consolidated Input</h3>
<p>To empower users and expedite the submission building process, eliminating the time consuming back and forth with a
curator when the researcher needs new/novel standardized data, all metadata including nomenclature-controlled data can
be loaded using a single excel spreadsheet.  A one-stop shop for all data in TraceBase makes the compilation of study
data as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>An excel speadsheet was chosen as the vehicle for the data because inter-sheet formulas are capable of providing select
lists for data entry, reducing the opportunities for user error and speeding up manual data entry.</p>
<h3 id="standardized-loading">Standardized Loading</h3>
<p>All loading functionality is inherited from a common source that handles the minutiae of loading data so that
individually developed loading scripts can focus on the data.  Every loading script is reversible, using a strategy
called atomic transactions.  This is what allows the loading code to be able to be re-used for the validation page, so
that the errors and warnings that the researcher sees while validating their data is exactly what the curator sees when
they attempt to load the submission into the database.</p>
<p>Also, each load data type defines the structure of the associated sheet in the Study Doc (xlsx file), which is
constructed dynamically.  It uses the database table definitions to populate the column headers and datatype and is thus
able to provide tips and information in the spreadsheet itself, while at the same time, making it robust to database
changes.  If a new database table or field is added or changed, updating the loading code is very straightforward and
the excel sheet update is automatic, making it fast and easy to adapt to change.</p>
<h3 id="customized-errors-and-warnings-and-handling">Customized Errors and Warnings and Handling</h3>
<p>Database errors on the validation interface can be cryptic and hard to interpret to understand what change is needed to
make in the data to fix it, even for developers, so particular attention was given to creating helpful errors for common
or not-so-common but difficult-to-solve errors.  Anytime an error was encountered, what was learned from the debug
process was saved in a custom error that explains what the issue is and when possible, a suggestion is made as to the
likely fix.</p>
<p>These errors and warnings are aggregated and organized into categorical groups to streamline the submission building
process.  Plus, since repeated similar errors can hamper the process of fixing a submission, similar errors are
collected and summarized in a master error, including the collation and summarization of similar errors from multiple
load scripts.</p>
<p>All of these error features come together to make it possible for researchers to be able to fix data issues on their
own, ensuring that data is loaded as quickly as possible and that researchers, who are the closest to the data, feel
empowered to handle things on their own, and retain a sense of ownership and control over their data, instead of waiting
for a curator to address the issues in a fashion that impeeds the researcher's input.</p>
<h3 id="template-creation-and-autofill">Template Creation and Autofill</h3>
<p>The most time consuming task in building a TraceBase submission is manual data entry.  To boost the study submission
building process, a custom template can be build by simply submitting all of the peak annotation files, along with
optional mass spec metadata associated with each file.  Samples and compounds will be parsed from those files and as
much metadata as is possible will be automatically entered into a downloaded template.  Standardized data from the
database will be included as well.</p>
<p>What's more is that every time you validate a study doc, any partially entered data will be propagated to other sheets
as well.  For example, if you enter a novel tissue name in the Samples sheet or a compound name in the Tracers sheet
that do not exist in the corresponding Tissues or Compounds sheet, that name will be added to the corresponding sheet in
the resulting download.</p>
<h2 id="universal-peak-annotation-format">Universal Peak Annotation Format</h2>
<p>TraceBase currently supports the following peak annotation file types (in excel, tsv, and csv format):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00396">AccuCor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz209">IsoCor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xxing9703/Iso-Autocorr">Iso-AutoCor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, TraceBase also supports its own internal format called <code>UniCorr</code>, which contains only the common portions of
each of the above formats that are relevant to TraceBase.  Each of those formats is automatically converted to the
<code>UniCorr</code> format so that the same loading code is used for every peak annotation data source.  Thus, to support a new
data type, all that needs to be developed is a converter to the <code>UniCorr</code> format, which is faster to do and easier to
maintain than dealing with a series of largely redundant loaders.</p>
<p>This makes TraceBase more robust to change and scalable, as support for new data types/formats are requested.</p>
